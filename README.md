# NetCraft

NetCraft is a game inspired by Minecraft being developed in GameMaker: Studio 1.4. The game runs entirely within a browser rather than a standalone executable. NetCraft will be put on its own website once it is in a playable state. In the meantime, you can try out the game by cloning it and running it in GameMaker.
